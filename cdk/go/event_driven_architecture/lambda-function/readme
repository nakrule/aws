### BUILD ###

Go code must be compile with some specific argument to be compatible with Lambda, as follow:

GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go
Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/golang-package.html#golang-package-mac-linux

To make this process easier, simply use "make" to automatically create a Lambda compatible
executable.


The code comes from the documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/golang-handler.html#golang-handler-structs


### TEST ###

You can test the function by sending the event saved in "test_event.json". It is not possible via
CDK/CloudFormation to create a test event in Lambda, hence why it is documented here.
